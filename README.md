# Purpose of the repository

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of the most commonly used shell
scripts that I'm using. Exceedingly useful when I decide to update them and
keep the version synchronized between my computers.

# Usage

For using the scripts, you just need to have the files in your `$PATH`. You can
copy or link the files to a directory that's already in `$PATH`, like I do, or
add the `shellscript/bin` to your path like in the following example.


    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/git/shellscripts/bin
